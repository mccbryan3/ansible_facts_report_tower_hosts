# PowerShell - Ansible Fact Report for Tower Hosts

# Summary

This script allows the ability to report on the tower hosts and their facts. This requires that fact cache be enabled on the Tower Job Templates. The output is a PowerShell hash and can be output to PowerShell Out-GridView, Export-CSV or other formats. All properties are accessible as object.property.
